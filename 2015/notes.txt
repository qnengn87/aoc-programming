day 3
location donoted by (x,y) where x is position relative to north and south, and y is position relative to east and west
go through the file
position starts with x = 0, y = 0
for each
if char = north, then x += 1
if char = south, then x -= 1
if char = east, then y += 1
if char = west, then y -= 1
current position = (x,y)
add current position to list of houses visited only if it's there isn't already an entry of the same position - if the house has already been visited

solution is the number of houses he visited  - count of the list item
